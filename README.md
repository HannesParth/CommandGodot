# CommandGodot
A clean example implementation of the Command Pattern in Godot 4.4 with added visualizations.

## Usage and Goal
This is meant to be a written tutorial explaining the command pattern for [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). 
The main priorties are understanding the purpose, core concept and functionality of the pattern.

The project has been implemented trying to follow the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles of programming and the [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).


### Disclaimer
This project uses my own terms of *persistent* and *discrete* commands. 

While this distinction is often used in explanations of the command pattern (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern#Terminology) or [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html#undo-and-redo)), I have not yet found an instance where it is named and explained from the start.
